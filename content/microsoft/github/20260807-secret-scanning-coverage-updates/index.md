This release expands secret scanning&rsquo;s coverage with more secrets blocked by push protection, one new secret scanning partner, and richer metadata on alerts.
Secret scanning partnership program
Lovable Labs is now a GitHub secret scanning partner. Secret scanning now automatically detects the following new secret type in your repositories.



Provider
Secret type




Lovable Labs
lovable_api_key



When a Lovable Labs secret is found in a public repository, GitHub forwards it to Lovable Labs so they can take appropriate action. Learn more about the secret scanning partner program.
Push protection defaults expanded
The following detectors are now included in push protection by default. Repositories with secret scanning enabled, including free public repositories, will automatically block commits containing these secrets.



Provider
Secret type




APIclub
apiclub_api_key


Mistral AI
mistral_ai_api_key


PostHog
posthog_oauth_access_token


Resend
resend_api_key



Extended metadata support
Extended metadata builds on secret scanning&rsquo;s validity checks, which confirm whether a detected secret is still active. When information is available from the provider, alerts also surface context (e.g., the secret&rsquo;s owner, its creation and expiry dates, and the associated project or organization) so you can assess ownership and impact without leaving the alert. The following patterns now include extended metadata when detected.



Provider
Secret type




Cohere
cohere_api_key


GoCardless
gocardless_live_access_token


GoCardless
gocardless_sandbox_access_token


Square
square_access_token



Metadata availability varies by provider, token type, and even by individual secret, so GitHub makes a best effort to display it when present.
